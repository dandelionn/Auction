* There are some isssues regarging lazy loading and eager loading remaining to solve but there is no point in continuing working on this project since I received the grade.(almost 10)

	The problem is that child objects are not retrieved from the database and this is related to lazy loading. Link to a possible solution to the problem: https://www.ryadel.com/en/enable-or-disable-lazyloading-in-entity-framework/
